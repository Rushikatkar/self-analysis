            <br>
            <b>Technical Round :</b>Questions about any aspect of the candidate's studies can be expected in this round.
             To pass this round, one must have a very good understanding of Computer Science fundamentals. A candidate should be familiar with data structures, 
             algorithms, database management systems, operating systems, networking, object-oriented programming ideas, and a programming language of their choice like C++,
              Java, Python, etc. Candidates from branches other than computer science should study subjects related to their field. During the interview, Computer Science candidates will be put to the test in terms of code. 
              The panel will also ask questions from the resume, so be sure to know what you've put in your CV (Curriculum Vitae).
             This round might also include puzzle related questions.

              <h2>HR Round</h2>You can expect general HR questions like :If a candidate has cleared the technical interviews,
               a final HR (Human Resource) Round takes place in which behavioural questions are asked to the candidate to test whether he or she is a cultural fit for the company or not.
                Most candidates assume that the HR interview is simple, but keep in mind that even if you have cleared all other hurdles, a poor HR interview can endanger your chances of getting the job.
                 Maintaining a nice and confident demeanour is the goal. Remember to smile throughout interviews because they can be long and tedious. The hiring process comes to a close at this point.
                 Adaptability is demanded of candidates, although this stage allows for negotiation. 
              Some of the questions which are asked during this round are as follows:
            <p>
                <ul>
                   <li> 1.Please tell me a little bit about yourself. </li>
                   <li> 2.Why do you wish to work in the field of information technology?</li>
                  <li> 3.What makes you want to work at Tech Mahindra?</li> 
                    <li>4.Are you open to relocating to various locations in India?</li> 
                   <li> 5.What do you think your pay will be? Answering this question is challenging. It is a question that most experienced employees are asked. You might inquire about the company's standard employee rise.</li>
                </ul>
